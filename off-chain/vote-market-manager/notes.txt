1) Get all delegated accounts
2) Get all guages with a vote buy account for the epoch
3) prepare first 3 accounts needed to vote for each gauge with a vote buy for each delegated account
4) Check power we have delegated. Check total power used so far. Assume delegated
accounts didn't vote yet.
5) Determine optimal vote weights. I think it is the same for every voter
6) Set weights for each gauge and commit for every voter
